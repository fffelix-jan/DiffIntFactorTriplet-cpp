# DiffIntFactorTriplet-cpp
A simple C++ program used to sets of three integer factors that are different and have a common product. This was ported from my original Python script.  

# Usage
After compiling the program, simply run the program and type in an integer, and press Enter/Return. It is a lot faster than the Python version.
